This app will detect motion using your computer camera. It will create an avi file of all the time the app is running, including showing the detected motion in green rectangles. This file can get quite large, so make sure you have space. It also creates a csv file giving the timestamps of when the motion started and when it ended. 
This is based on a Udemy python megaproject course to which I added the file saving code. It seemed much more useful to be able to see what is actually happening which the camera is on. A future branch will include a more user-friendly output of the timestamps.
